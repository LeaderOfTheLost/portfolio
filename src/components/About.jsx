      <h1>My Journey</h1>

      <p className="about-para">
        I am a software engineer with a passion for design. My design journey
        started in high school where I found a love for photography and editing.
        I studied graphic design in college before life threw a few curveballs
        my way.

        After college I took a different route and jumped at the oppotunity to
        become a commercial diver and scuba instructor. I spent the next 5 years
        training new divers, fixing and testing equipment, and taking on some
        training of my own.

        As much as I had enjoyed being a scuba instructor it was time for my
        journey to take another turn. That is when I began studying Computer
        Information Systems.

        Once I had my degree in CIS, I was left wanting more. I found General
        Assembly and enrolled in their software engineering immersive.

        Now after graduating from GA I use my passion for design, collaberation,
        and accessability to create well rounded, user friendly applications.
