            I am a software engineer with a passion for design. My design
            journey started in high school where I found a love for photography
            and editing. I studied graphic design in college before life threw a
            few curveballs my way.

            After college I took a different route and jumped at the oppotunity
            to become a commercial diver and scuba instructor. I spent the next
            5 years training new divers, fixing and testing equipment, and
            taking on some training of my own.

            As much as I had enjoyed being a scuba instructor it was time for my
            journey to take another turn. That is when I began studying Computer
            Information Systems.

            Once I had my degree in CIS, I was left wanting more. I found
            General Assembly and enrolled in their software engineering
            immersive.

          <p className="about-para">
            Now after graduating from GA I use my passion for design,
            collaberation, and accessability to create well rounded, user
            friendly applications.
